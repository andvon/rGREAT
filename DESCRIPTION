Description: GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) is a type of
    functional enrichment analysis directly performed on genomic regions. This package 
    implements the GREAT algorithm (the local GREAT analysis), also it supports directly 
    interacting with the GREAT web service (the online GREAT analysis). Both analysis 
    can be viewed by a Shiny application.
